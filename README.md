  This is a project for me to learn some of the ins and outs of managing a user interacting with a page and reflecting results back to the user. I build this project from scratch, and I wanted to challenge myself by not using any tutorials and only referencing google to solve any of the problems I had along the way.

  In regards to typescript I learnt alot about creating an accurate interface, as well as using type guards to solve any errors which Typescript threw my way.

  If you would like to open this project and use the calculator, download the repo and host it with whatever CLI hosting service you wish for the index.html file (serve, dev), the compiled TS file will exist as the linked script file in the html as well as the INITIAL_JS_RAW.js file which I included but is not used. It's just the original javascript code I wrote to get the calculator working initially.
